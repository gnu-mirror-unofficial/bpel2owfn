<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<h3 class="section">1.1 Introduction</h3>

<p><acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> is a compiler translating a business processes expressed in
<acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> (Business Process Execution Language for Web Services)
[ACD^+03] to an <acronym title="open Workflow Net">oWFN</acronym> (open Workflow Net) [MRS05]. 
This <acronym title="open Workflow Net">oWFN</acronym> can be used to:

     <ul>
<li>check controllability [Mar03, Wei04],
<li>generate the operating guidelines [MRS05],
<li>check for deadlocks, or
<li>check any temporal logic formula expressed in
<acronym title="Computation Tree Logic">CTL</acronym> (Computation Tree Logic) with the model checking tool
<acronym title="Low-Level Analyzer">LoLA</acronym> (Low-Level Analyzer) [Sch00]. 
</ul>

<p>In future versions of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> static analysis is used to
find the smallest <acronym title="open Workflow Net">oWFN</acronym> to analyze a chosen property. This
is called <i>flexible model generation</i> (see <a href="#Future-Work">Future Work</a>).

<p><acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> was written by Niels Lohmann, Christian Gierds
and Dennis Reinert. It is part of the Tools4<acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> project
funded by the Bundesministerium f&uuml;r Bildung und Forschung. See
<a href="http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/tools4bpel">http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/tools4bpel</a> for details.

<h3 class="section">1.2 Translation Process</h3>

<p>The translation process of the <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> business process is performed in
six steps which we describe briefly in this section:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><b>Lexical and syntactical analysis</b>. <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> parses the
input process according to the specification of <acronym>BPEL4WS</acronym> version 1.1
[ACD^+03]. All information about the process is collected in a symbol
table for further use.

     <li><b>Semantic analysis</b>. The input file is checked against the constraints
of the specification, e.g. that each defined link has to be used as source and
target exactly once. <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> processes violating these constraints are
rejected.

     <li><b><acronym>AST</acronym> generation</b>. For further analysis steps the exact syntax
(indentation etc.) is not used any more. The input process is represented as
an <acronym title="abstract syntax tree">AST</acronym> (abstract syntax tree). While generating the <acronym title="abstract syntax tree">AST</acronym>, the
implicit transformation rules of <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> (e.g. the presence of an
<span class="samp">otherwise</span>-branch with an empty activity) are applied.

     <li><b>Net generation</b>. The nodes of the <acronym title="abstract syntax tree">AST</acronym> are used to create
the Petri net using the pattern database by applying `unparse'-rules (rules
associating each node with a pattern).

     <li><b>Net optimization</b> (optional). To reduce the generated net several
structural reduction rules can be applied, e.g. to merge sequences.

     <li><b>Net output</b>. The generated Petri net can be exported in several file
formats.
     </ol>

<h3 class="section">1.3 Concepts of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym></h3>

<p>In this section we describe the main concepts of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> used to
realize the translation. Reading this section is not necessary for using
<acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym>, yet knowing the underlying algorithms and data structures
not only helps to locate bugs, but also helps you to customize
<acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> or request a feature.

<p><a name="Abstract-Syntax-Tree"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 Abstract Syntax Tree</h4>

<p>The <acronym title="abstract syntax tree">AST</acronym> (abstract syntax tree) is an abstraction of the
syntax tree generated while parsing the <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> process: any
unnecessary information (e.g. indention, brackets or other
&ldquo;syntax-supporting&rdquo; elements) is omitted. It is the central data
structure of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym>. The nodes of the <acronym title="abstract syntax tree">AST</acronym> are
annotated during the analysis steps. These annotations are used to
select the most compact Petri net pattern from the pattern database
to check a given property.

<p><a name="Pattern-Database"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.2 Pattern Database</h4>

<p>The idea of flexible model generation is to find the most compact
model to check a given property. The patterns of the Petri net
semantics of [Sta05] are designed to fit in any given context. 
However when the context is known some behavior modeled in the
patterns (i.e. some of the nodes) can be safely removed without
changing its semantics. <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> is designed to hold
several sets of Petri net patterns each suitable in certain
contexts. These patterns are collected in a pattern database.

<p><a name="Petri-Net-Class"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.3 Petri Net Class</h4>

<p><acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> provides many algorithms and data structures to
build, represent, modify and simplify Petri nets and open workflow
nets, resp. They are the interface between the pattern database and
the file output for the model checking tool. The functions are
collected in an extensible class allowing to add more output file
formats (e.g. <acronym title="Petri Net Markup Language">PNML</acronym> (Petri Net Markup Language),
<acronym>PEP</acronym> notation, etc.), structural simplification rules
(optimized to preserve certain properties such as deadlock freedom
or liveness) or abstractions (e.g. abstraction from variables,
abstraction from external behavior).

<h2 class="chapter">2 Invoking <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym></h2>

<p>The standard invocation of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> is:

<pre class="example">     bpel2owfn -f inputfile.bpel -O2F
</pre>
<p>where <span class="file">inputfile.bpel</span> is a <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> process. The option
<code>-O2F</code> causes <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> to generate an open workflow
net named <span class="file">inputfile.owfn</span> and a file <span class="file">inputfile.info</span>
describing the places and transitions of the net. For more examples,
see <a href="#Examples">Examples</a>.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Options</h3>

<p><acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> supports the following command-line options:

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">--file </span><var>filename</var><span class="samp">.bpel</span><dt><span class="samp">-f </span><var>filename</var><span class="samp">.bpel</span><dd>Read <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> input from file <var>filename</var><span class="file">.bpel</span>. The
filename is used to name any files generated by <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym>. 
If this parameter is omitted, input is read from standard input.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">--help</span><dt><span class="samp">-h</span><dd>Print an overview of the command-line options and exit.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">--version</span><dt><span class="samp">-v</span><dd>Print version information and exit. 
</dl>

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Output modes</h4>

<p>When invoking <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> several output modes are possible. 
While the <span class="samp">-pn</span>-mode can be implied by other options the other
modes have to be set explicitly. Either way, at most one of these
options can be chosen.

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">--ast</span><dt><span class="samp">-a</span><dd>Outputs the <acronym title="abstract syntax tree">AST</acronym> (abstract syntax tree) generated while
parsing the input file to standard output. This option is mostly
used for debugging reasons.

<p><a name="Examples"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Examples</h3>

<p>In this section we show some examples how <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> can be
invoked.

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">bpel2owfn -f sample.bpel -L2F -s</span><dd>
Reads the file <span class="file">sample.bpel</span>, generates a structural simplified
low-level Petri net and saves it in a <acronym title="Low-Level Analyzer">LoLA</acronym> file
<span class="file">sample.lola</span>. For further information a file
<span class="file">sample.info</span> is generated.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">bpel2owfn -f sample.bpel -O2F -ddd</span><dd>
Reads the file <span class="file">sample.bpel</span>, generates a low-level open
workflow net and saves it in an <acronym title="open Workflow Net">oWFN</acronym> file
<span class="file">sample.owfn</span>. For further information a file
<span class="file">sample.info</span> is generated. During the conversion several debug
messages are printed to standard output.

     <br><dt><var>prog</var><span class="samp"> | bpel2owfn -D -ll | dot -Tpng -osample.png</span><dd>
Runs the program <var>prog</var> and reads its output as <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym>
process, generates a low-level Petri net and outputs its Dot
representation. This stream is read by Dot which layouts the Petri
net and creates an output <acronym title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</acronym> (Portable Network Graphic)
file <span class="file">sample.png</span>.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">bpel2owfn -f sample.bpel -a</span><dd>
Reads the file <span class="file">sample.bpel</span> and prints the abstract syntax tree
(<acronym title="abstract syntax tree">AST</acronym>) to standard output. 
</dl>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Exit Values</h3>

<p>When <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> is invoked and run without any error, the
exit value is 0.

     <dl>

<h2 class="chapter">3 File Formats</h2>

<p><acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> can generate several file formats:

<h3 class="section">3.1 <acronym title="Low-Level Analyzer">LoLA</acronym> place/transition net</h3>

<p>A (low-level) place/transition net as described in [LoLA]. The places and
transitions are named using the internal (numeric) name of each node. 
Furthermore, the first entry of the history of each node is added as a comment.

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     { Petri net created by BPEL2oWFN reading <var>filename.bpel</var> }

     MARKING
       <var>the initial marking</var>
     
     <var>a comma-separated list of transitions</var>
     
     { END OF FILE }
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>For more information on the node naming conventions of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym>, see
<a href="#Naming-Conventions">Naming Conventions</a>.

<h3 class="section">3.2 <acronym title="open Workflow Net">oWFN</acronym> in <acronym title="Low-Level Analyzer">LoLA</acronym> format</h3>

<p>An open workflow net is a Petri net with an <i>interface</i>, i.e. two sets of
places: <i>input places</i> and <i>output places</i>. To represent <acronym title="open Workflow Net">oWFN</acronym>s
the <acronym title="Low-Level Analyzer">LoLA</acronym> format was extended to implement this categorization:

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     { oWFN created by BPEL2oWFN reading <var>filename.bpel</var> }
     
     PLACE
       INPUT
         <var>a comma-separated list of input places</var>
       OUTPUT
         <var>a comma-separated list of output places</var>
       INTERNAL
         <var>a comma-separated list of internal places</var>
     
     MARKING
       <var>the initial marking</var>
     
     <var>a comma-separated list of transitions</var>
     
     { END OF FILE }
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Additionally an open workflow net has a set of final markings. Since there
exist no tools reading <acronym title="open Workflow Net">oWFN</acronym>s yet, the representation of final
markings is not implemented.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Info-files</h3>

<p>The Info-files are generated when any command-line option is used which imply
Petri net-generation. When reading from a file <span class="file">process.bpel</span> a file
<span class="file">process.info</span> is generated. This file sums up all places and transitions
together with their internal (numeric) name and their complete history:

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     PLACES:
     ID  TYPE        ROLES
     <var>a list of places</var>
     
     TRANSITIONS:
     ID  GUARD       ROLES
     <var>a list of transitions</var>
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>These files are generated to document the connection between the generated
output file and the chosen Petri net patterns. In future distributions of
<acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> the Info-files will be used to annotate witness and
counter-example paths, resp. and to &ldquo;re-translate&rdquo; Petri net properties (e.g. 
a dead transition) to the input <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> process.

<p>For more information on the node naming conventions of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym>, see
<a href="#Naming-Conventions">Naming Conventions</a>.

<p><a name="Naming-Conventions"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.3.1 Naming Conventions</h4>

<p><acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> generates the output Petri net by creating and
merging parameterized patterns of the Petri net semantics defined in
[Sta05]. Due to merging and simplifying the Petri net nodes
&ldquo;belong&rdquo; to more than one pattern. For example, in a sequence the
initial place of the sequence and the initial place of its first
activity are merged so that the final Petri net contains one place
with two <i>roles</i>.

<p>The roles of each place are collected during the Petri net
generation. They form the <i>history</i> of the node. It is used to
locate errors of the modeled business process: If, for example,
<acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> generates a Petri net of a business process and
the model checker <acronym title="Low-Level Analyzer">LoLA</acronym> finds a dead transition, its
history helps to find which <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> constructs are affected
and in this case will never be executed.

<p>The roles are named using the following conventions:

     <ul>
<li>Each <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> activity has been assigned an identifier during the
syntactic analysis of the input process. Each node added to the Petri net
from the Petri net pattern of that activity begins with that identifier.

     <p>For example, <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym>'s activity process has the identifier <span class="samp">1</span>,
so that all nodes of the process pattern begin with <span class="samp">1.</span>. To find out the
identifiers of a given process use the <span class="samp">--xml</span> command-line option which
prints the id of each activity as an <acronym>XML</acronym> attribute.

     <li>In most cases each <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> activity can be source or target of
links. The semantics defined in [Sta05] organizes this link concept by several
wrappers. For an activity with the identifier <var>id</var> the nodes of the wrapper
begin with <var>id</var><span class="samp">.</span> whereas the nodes of the actual activity begin
with <var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.</span>.

     <li>The roles of nodes of the stop pattern of a process or scope with
identifier <var>id</var> begin with <var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.stop.</span>.

     <p>The same schema is used for fault handlers
(<var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.faultHandler.</span>), compensation handlers
(<var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.compensationHandler.</span>) and event handlers
(<var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.eventHandler.</span>), resp.

     <li>Labels (e.g. <span class="samp">initial</span>) in a figure of [Sta05] are appended to the
id string (e.g. <var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.initial</span>). If both numeric (e.g. 
<span class="samp">p1</span>) and textual (e.g. <span class="samp">initial</span>) labels are depicted in a figure,
the latter is used.

     <li>The labels of fault-throwing transitions also contain the last place of
the positive control flow: If, for example, a reply activity throws a fault,
the fault-throwing transition reads from the place labeled
<var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.running</span> and is labeled
<var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.throwFault.running</span>.

     <li>In parameterized patterns (e.g. an assign activity or all structured
activities) the labels of the figures of [Sta05] are trailed by an numeration
(e.g. <var>id</var><span class="samp">.internal.copy.</span><var>number</var><span class="samp">.running</span>).

<h2 class="chapter">4 Petri Net Patterns</h2>

<p>In version 1.0 of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> the following Petri net
patterns are implemented:

<h3 class="section">4.1 Petri net semantics from [Sta05]</h3>

<p>The Petri net semantics for <acronym>BPEL4WS</acronym> from Christian Stahl
(Humboldt-Universit&auml;t zu Berlin) published in [Sta04].

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.1 Overview</h4>

<p>Feature complete semantics covering both positive control flow with
event handling and negative control flow (fault and compensation
handling).

<p><a name="Limitations-of-the-semantics"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.2 Limitations of the semantics</h4>

     <ul>
<li>Only one instance of a <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> process can be
transformed into a Petri net.

     <li>The semantics abstracts from the connection of a
<acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> process to its partner processes. The interface of a
<acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> process is transformed into a set of message
channels, i.e. places in the Petri net.

     <li>In our Petri net patterns we model data, but we abstract from
the definition of the functions which edit the data. Furthermore, we
did not specify the transition guards and so we did not specify
which circumstances are necessary that a specific fault can occur.

     <li>Every activity is limited to one correlation set (except the
synchronous invoke which is limited to two correlation sets).

</ul>

<p><a name="Changes-and-Modulation"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.3 Changes and Modulation</h4>

<p>We tried to stick as close to the Petri net patterns of [Sta05] as
possible. However, the implemented patterns in the pattern database
sometimes differ to the given patterns due to discovery of bugs or
implementation decisions. In this subsection we sum up these changes
to help you understand the generated Petri net model.

     <ul>
<li><b>Faults</b>. At most one error can occur in the positive
control flow of each scope or process. Yet this confines the
possible runs of the process it is only a little change of the
semantics, since &mdash; according to the specification &mdash; only the
first fault is handled anyway. While further faults occurring before
the positive control flow is stopped are ignored in the original
semantics of [Sta05] (in fact, the faults are collected on place
<span class="samp">fault_in</span> and then consumed by a reset arc) they are prevented
in the implemented semantics. In our model, exactly the <i>first</i>
occurring fault is handled, whereas in [Sta05] one fault is chosen
non-deterministically.

     <p>Furthermore, all <span class="samp">failed</span> places of the activities were
removed. In the original Petri net semantics, all faults of a scope
were collected on the <span class="samp">fault_in</span> of the stop-pattern and then
classified as being the first fault of the scope, a following fault,
a fault from the fault handler, a fault from the compensation
handler, or a fault from a child scope. In our implementation, new
places (<span class="samp">fh_fault_in</span> and <span class="samp">ch_fault_in</span>) were introduced
and each activity throws its faults to the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; place
automatically.

     <p>To ensure that at most one error can occur (i.e. at most one token
is produced on any fault place) the fault places are guarded by
state places: To throw a fault from an activity enclosed in a scope,
the state of that scope has to be <span class="samp">Active</span>. The first thrown
fault changes the state to <span class="samp">!Active</span> thus preventing more
faults to occur. The places <span class="samp">fh_fault_in</span> and
<span class="samp">ch_fault_in</span>, resp. are guarded by
<span class="samp">!FHFaulted</span>/<span class="samp">FHFaulted</span> and
<span class="samp">!CHFaulted</span>/<span class="samp">CHFaulted</span>, resp.

     <p>Moreover, the generated Petri nets have less nodes than those
generated by <acronym>BPEL2PN</acronym> [SHS05] since an unfolding of the
reset arcs in not necessary any more.

     <li><b>1-safety</b>. The new modeling of the fault management yields
to 1-safe Petri nets (i.e. any reachable state of the Petri net
model puts at most one token on each place of the net).

     <p>Beside performance (e.g. only 1 bit is needed to store the marking
of a place) and compatibility issues (e.g. 1-safety is a
prerequisite to use the Model Checking Kit [MCK]), features not
supported by the Petri net semantics can be discovered since the
generated net will most likely violate 1-safety when an unsupported
<acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> feature is used. If, for example, a scope is enclosed
in a while loop (which would model instantiation which is not
supported by the Petri net semantics <a href="#Limitations-of-the-semantics">Limitations of the semantics</a>), the state places of that scope would not be 1-safe.

     <li><b>Assign activity</b>. All copy branches of an assign activity
are modeled in a single pattern (i.e. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 are merged). 
Furthermore, when an error (outside that activity) occurs, an active
assign-activity is not stopped until all copy branches have
finished. This is described in [ACD^+03] as:

     <blockquote>
The assign activities are sufficiently short-lived that they are allowed to
complete rather than being interrupted when termination is forced. 
</blockquote>

     <p>This change fixes a bug in the Petri net semantics.

     <li><b>Event handlers</b>. There is one pattern for both alarm and
message event handlers (i.e. Fig. 29 and Fig. 30 are merged). When
no event handler is specified, an &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; event handler is
installed which is just a stub and does not change the semantics.

     <li><b>Deadlocks</b>. A transition named <span class="samp">1.internal.finishloop</span>
was added to livelock the process upon completion. This leads to
deadlock-free Petri nets in case of processes with &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;
control flow and helps to find unwanted deadlocks occurring due
wrong modeling. If, for example, the links of a process model are
cyclic the generated Petri net will deadlock.

     <p>In future versions of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> these found deadlocks
shall be mapped back into the <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> code to highlight the
&ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; activities (i.e. a cycle-closing link).

     <li><b>Unfoldings</b>. Due to the abstraction (high-level to
low-level) of the patterns some places were unfolded: the place
<span class="samp">compScope</span> of Fig. 42&ndash;44. usually holding a token with a name
of a scope is unfolded to <span class="samp">compScope.</span><var>scopename</var> and only
merged with the <span class="samp">ch_in</span>-place of that respective scope. In all
other cases the places are &ldquo;converted&rdquo; to low-level places so the
generated model completely abstracts from data.

     <li><b>Link semantics</b>. The generated Petri net model always
generates <span class="samp">negLink</span> places for structured activities
independently of the presence of links. Anyway, the semantics is not
changed since the resulting subnets are dead in this case.

     <li><b>Correlation sets</b>. Correlation sets are not implemented and
are simply ignored during parsing. 
</ul>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Petri Net related Functions</h2>

<p>Currently implemented Petri net-specific functions:

<h3 class="section">5.1 Structural Simplification</h3>

     <ul>
<li>If two transitions t_1 and t_2 have the same
preset and postset, one of them can be removed.

     <li>If a transition has a singleton preset and postset, the
transition can be removed (sequence) and the preset and postset can
be merged. </ul>

<p>These structural reduction rules are implemented in the command-line option
<span class="samp">--simplify</span>, see <a href="#Invoking-BPEL2oWFN">Invoking BPEL2oWFN</a>).

<h3 class="section">5.2 Abstractions</h3>

     <ul>
<li>To obtain a place/transition Petri net from an open workflow
net the communication places are removed. (Implemented in
command-line option <span class="samp">--lola</span>.)

     <li>To improve readability of the implemented patterns all
transition guards, arc inscriptions and arc types were adopted from
[Sta05]. To &ldquo;convert&rdquo; these patterns to a low-level Petri net, all
transition guards and arc inscriptions were removed (decisions are
now made non-deterministically) and read arcs are &ldquo;unfolded&rdquo; to
loops. Due to a new fault management (see <a href="#Changes-and-Modulation">Changes and Modulation</a>) the semantics does not contain any reset arcs.

     <p>These abstractions are implemented in the command-line option
<span class="samp">--low-level</span>. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">5.3 Markings</h3>

<p>The following places are initially marked to ensure a deadlock-free
model of processes with &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; control-flow (e.g. with an
acyclic link structure):

     <ul>
<li>the initial place of the process (<span class="samp">1.internal.initial</span>),

     <li>the variable places (<span class="samp">variable.</span><var>variablename</var>), and

     <li>the clock (<span class="samp">1.internal.clock</span>).

</ul>

<p>All interleavings should end in a livelock-marking which covers
<span class="samp">1.internal.final</span> and in which only transition
<span class="samp">1.internal.finishloop</span> can fire. All livelock-markings differ
in the marking of the state places of the process and its child
scopes.

<p>Deadlocks indicate modeling mistakes (e.g. a cyclic link structure). 
Non-1-safe markings indicate the usage of an unsupported feature of
the Petri net semantics (e.g. instantiation, see <a href="#Limitations-of-the-semantics">Limitations of the semantics</a>).

<h2 class="chapter">6 Limitations and Bugs</h2>

<h3 class="section">6.1 Limitations</h3>

<p>The current version of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> underlies several limitations:

     <ul>
<li>The pattern database consists of only one collection of patterns (i.e. the
semantics of [Sta05], see <cite>Petri Net Patterns</cite>). 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">6.2 Known Bugs</h3>

<p>As this is the first public version of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> the
translation from a <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> process to an open workflow net
might be unstable or incorrect in some few scenarios:

     <ul>
<li><b>Problem:</b> The original semantics of [Sta05] was created to
support executable <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> processes. Therefore the
translation of abstract <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> processes (business
protocols) might throw an exception or even crash.

     <p><b>Solution:</b> Each communicating activity (i.e. <code>invoke</code>,
<code>receive</code>, <code>reply</code>) should be defined with (input/output)
variables.

     <li><b>Problem:</b> The implementation of the structural reduction
rules might crash when applied to <acronym title="Business Process Execution Language for Web Services">BPEL</acronym> processes that
created Petri nets with a large number of nodes.

     <p><b>Solution:</b> Avoid using the <span class="samp">-s</span> mode in this case.

     <li><b>Problem:</b> The parser of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> is not capable
of skipping <acronym>XML</acronym> elements originating other namespaces than
`<code>bpws</code>'. Processes using these elements are rejected with a
syntax error message.

     <p><b>Solution:</b> Try removing or commenting these elements.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Future Work</h2>

<p>For future releases of <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym> the following features are planned:

     <ul>
<li><b>Flexible model generation</b>. Originally, <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym>
was designed to support flexible model generation, i.e. finding the
most abstract (thus smallest) model capable to check a given
property. With static analysis we hope to generate the smallest
Petri net possible to check properties like deadlock-freedom or
controllability.

     <li><b>More Petri net patterns</b>. Being feature-complete the Petri
nets generated from the Petri net semantics of [Sta05] consist of a
large number of nodes and might be to large to be analyzed by model
checkers. The elaboration of different petri net patterns
specialized for certain purposes (e.g. omitting the negative control
flow) does not only help to find smaller models, but is also a
prerequisite for flexible model generation.

     <li><b>More output file formats</b>. The currently supported output
file formats limit the analysis of the generated Petri net to the
model checker <acronym title="Low-Level Analyzer">LoLA</acronym>. The support of more output file
formats such as the low-level <acronym>PEP</acronym> notation allows the
analysis of the generated models with the large number of both
explicit and symbolic model checking tools embedded in the Model
Checking Kit [MCK].

     <li><b>Detailed info-files</b>. The generated info-files currently just
list the nodes of the generated net. To help the retranslation of Petri
net-specific properties to the input process the generated files have
to be more detailed.

     <li><b>Support for <acronym>WS-BPEL</acronym></b>. The specification of
<acronym title="Web Service Business Process Execution Language">WS-BPEL</acronym> (Web Service Business Process Execution Language)
version 2.0 is in its final phase. As soon as the standardization is
completed, <acronym title="Web Service Business Process Execution Language">WS-BPEL</acronym> can be supported by <acronym>BPEL2oWFN</acronym>
by overworking the grammar and adding appropriate patterns to the
pattern database.

<h3 class="heading">Preamble</h3>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software&mdash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &ldquo;Program,&rdquo; below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &ldquo;work based on the Program&rdquo;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &ldquo;modification.&rdquo;)  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you.&rdquo;

     <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

     <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

     <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

          <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          </ol>

     <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

     <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

     <li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

          <li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

          <li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          </ol>

     <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

     <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

     <li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

     <li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

     <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

     <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

     <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     <li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

     <li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &ldquo;any
later version,&rdquo; you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

     <li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

     <li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     <li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
     </ol>

<h3 class="heading">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) 19<var>yy</var>  <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the <acronym>GNU</acronym> General Public License along
     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
</pre>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 20<var>yy</var> <var>name of author</var>
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.
</pre>
<p>The hypothetical commands <span class="samp">show w</span> and <span class="samp">show c</span> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <span class="samp">show w</span> and
<span class="samp">show c</span>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items&mdash;whatever
suits your program.

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre class="smallexample">     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.
     
     <var>signature of Ty Coon</var>, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice
</pre>
<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Library General
Public License instead of this License.
